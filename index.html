        <h1>Gangster Films</h1>
        <p>
          A gang is an organized group of criminals. A gangster is a member of a
          gang, always shown as a man. A gangster movie shows gangs fighting and
          changing and completing jobs. Different cultures have different ideas
          of what gangsters are like and what makes a good gangster movie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a selection of clips from gangster movies in India, South
          Korea, and England. For each country, we have a love scene and a fight
          scene, whatever that means in each place.
        </p>

      <div class="slide">
        <h1> India </h1>
        <p>
          Indian movies have the most tame love scenes. Naked women are very
          rare and kissing is about the most intense on-screen action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Action fight scenes in indian gangster movies can be like Japanese
          warrior style, or like boxing matches, or like gun fights. There's a
          lot of diversity here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below you'll see a fight scene then a love scene from
          <i>Once Upon a Time in Mumbai</i>
          (directed by Milan Luthria and released in 2010) and then a fight scene and love
          scene from
          <i> Gangs of Wasseypur </i>
          (directed by Anurag Kashyap and released in 2012).
          The two love scenes are quite different.

    <div id="korea">
      <div class="slide">
        <h1> Korea </h1>
        <p>
          Koreans really like super long uncut fight scenes. There's a very
          famous one in <i>The Protector</i> (2005) that climbs five stories in
          a spiral staircase and lasts eight minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Korean movies have the most intense, explicit love scenes of any
          country I've scene. Most love scenes are sex scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a fight scene and a love scene from the South Korean film
          <i>Oldboy</i> (directed by Chan-wook Park and released in 2003). The
          love scene goes pretty far, so I cut it off early.

        <h1> England </h1>
        <p>
          British Gangster movies have the best and most complicated
          inter-gang-relations. You have to effort to keep track of who is in
          which group, why the groups hate each other, whose house they're in.
          It is very based around character motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Layer Cake</i> (directed by Matthew Vaughn and released in 1998)
          and <i>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</i> (directed by Guy
          Ritchie and released in 1998) are both awesome examples of this
          complexity. <i>Barrels</i> even breaks the formula by excluding a love
          interest and a love scene, leaving focus entirely on gang relations.
          Below is a love scene and a fight scene from <i>Cake</i> and then a
          shoot out from <i>Barrels</i>.
