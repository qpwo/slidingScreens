# Gangster Movie [Sliding](http://lukexmiles.com/slidingScreens) Screens

In Spring 2016 I was taking a class at WKU called

project at the end. For mine, I collected different
scenes from different Gangster movies from different
countries. I tried to put them in this pretty CSS
display, check it out. I was learning.
